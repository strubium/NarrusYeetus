# Narrus Yeetus
Remove the pesky narrator and all the errors related to it.
---

Has the Narrator flooded your chat will bogus errors?

Has it damaged your ears by yelling at you?

Has it said bad words about your mother?

Has it scared you at a late dark night?

Do you just not like it?

If you answered yes to any of these questions then this mod is for you!
I just takes all of your pent-up frustrations and anger and points it towards the narrator.
Aka this mod just removes the narrator.

### Quilt?
The quilt loader loads mods later. So there is no quilt version for now.
*My apologies*

None :)
